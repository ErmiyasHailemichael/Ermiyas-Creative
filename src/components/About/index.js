        <h1>About me</h1>
        <p>
          Greetings! I graduated from General Assembly's Software Engineering
          Immersive boot camp, where I acquired valuable experience working on
          real-world projects and sharpened my skills in collaborative
          development, agile methodologies, and problem-solving.
        </p>
        <p>
          My ability to thrive in team-based software development environments
          makes me an ideal candidate for any dynamic and innovative team. As a
          part-time teacher at Coding With Kids, I teach K-12 students how to
          code in Scratch, Python, Javascript, HTML, and CSS.
        </p>
        <p>
          I am also currently studying Computer Science at Seattle Central
          College, as I am passionate about staying up-to-date with the latest
          technologies and industry trends. I am always eager to learn and grow
          as a developer by taking on new challenges and opportunities.
